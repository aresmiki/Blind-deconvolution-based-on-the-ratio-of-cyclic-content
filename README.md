# Blind-deconvolution-based-on-the-ratio-of-cyclic-content
This is the Matlab code of the blind deconvolution based on the ratio of cyclic content (BD-RCC). BD-RCC can be used to recover repetitive impacts signal in noisy vibration.

The simulation example shows that BD-RCC superior than CYCBD, MCKD, MOMEDA and MCG-L1/L2-D.

MCG-L1/L2-D：Minimum correlated generalized L1/L2 deconvolution
MCKD：Maximum correlated kurtosis deconvolution
CYCBD：Maximum second-order cyclo-stationarity blind deconvolution
MOMEDA：Multipoint optimal minimum entropy deconvolution adjusted
